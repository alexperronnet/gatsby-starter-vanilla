# Gatsby Starter Vanilla

A clean vanilla starter with the essentials for Gatsby. No surcharge, only what you need to get started. So you can add only the dependencies which are useful for you.

## Quick start

### Create a Gatsby site

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

```shell
# create a new Gatsby site using the gatsby starter vanilla
gatsby new my-new-app https://github.com/alexperronnet/gatsby-starter-vanilla
```

### Start developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd my-new-app
```
```shell
gatsby develop
```

### Open the source code and start editing

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

Open the `my-new-app` directory in your code editor edit `src/pages/index.js` save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

```
├── node_modules
├── src
├── static
├── .gitignore
├── gatsby-browser.js
├── gatsby-config.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── gatsby-ssr.js
├── LICENSE
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

**`/node_modules`** This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

**`/src`** This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

**`/static`** Every file you put into that folder will be copied into the `public` folder.

**`.gitignore`** This file tells git which files it should not track

**`gatsby-browser.js`** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

**`gatsby-config.js`** This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

**`gatsby-node.js`** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

**`gatsby-ssr.js`** This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

**`LICENSE`** This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

**`package.json`** A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

**`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

**`README.md`** A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
